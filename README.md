# Technologies Used: 

Memoria was built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML was used to create the basic layout and structure of the game, consisting of images, a scoreboard, and lives counter. CSS was used to create the look and styling of the game, including the placement of cards and the visual appearance of the front and back of the cards. JavaScript was used to create the dynamic and interactive elements of the game, including the randomization of cards, event listeners for card clicks, scorekeeping, and game management.



# Getting Started:

To start playing Memoria, simply click on your first card. After clicking your first card, click on your second card. If the two cards match, you will be awarded a match and can move on to your next set of cards. If the cards do not match, you will lose a life. You have two lives to make all the matches on the Memoria memory game board. If you lose both of your lives, the game is over. You can reset the game at any time by clicking the refresh button on the bottom of the screen.

# Next Steps:

The developers of Memoria have future plans to enhance the game's look and feel by improving the styling with CSS and adding a dark mode setting in the top-right corner of the screen. Stay tuned for updates and new features!
